How to contribute?
==================

If you are looking to contribute make sure to install ``qibocal`` using poetry.

.. code-block::

      git clone https://github.com/qiboteam/qibocal.git
      cd qibocal
      poetry install

We also invite you to use `precommit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ to enforce automation
and standardize tools for all the developers. Once you have downloaded the ``qibocal`` package
you can install the pre-commit hooks by typing:


.. code-block::

      pre-commit install

inside the installation directory.
